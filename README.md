## Installation

```python
pip install lanplaypy
```

## Script Example

- Here is an example of a simple script using LanPlay API

```python
import asyncio
import lanplay

# The LAN_PLAY_API_KEY can be found in the Console Mode of any Web Browser by following these steps:
# - Open a Web Browser and go to http://www.lan-play.com
# - Open a Console Mode ('Ctrl + Shift + C' should work, or else Google is your friend :))
# - Go to 'Network' tab and refresh the current page
# - Search a line named 'getMonitors' and click on it
# - Open the 'Payload' tab
# - Copy the 'api_key' value and paste it into the LanPlay('LAN_PLAY_API_KEY') definition below

async def main():
    # Create an instance of the LanPlay class with LAN_PLAY_API_KEY
    # It's the main variable where all data will be stored
    lan = lanplay.LanPlay('LAN_PLAY_API_KEY')

    # Initialize the server
    await lan.setServer('joinsg.net:11453') # Or 'http:/joinsg.net:11453/' will works too

    # You can now access all data from 'lan' variable
    # Here are some useful examples below    
    for room in lan.rooms:
        # Display games info of a room
        print(room.host_player_nintendo_name)   # Unique Nintendo host player name
        print(room.game.name)       # Or 'room.game' will also displays the name of the game
        print(room.game.icon_url)   # Useful when you want a cool picture of the current game played
        print(room.game.size)       # To see if you've enough space to download this game on your Switch...
        
        for player in room.players:
            # Display players infos of a room
            print(player.player_name)   # Or 'player' will also displays the name of the player

    print(lan.server_info.online)   # Displays the current number of Online players in the server
    print(lan.server_info.idle)     # Displays the current number of Idle players in the server

    print(lan.servers)      # Useful when you don't know wich LanPlay server to choose...

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
loop.close()
```

- Or you can also use it in CLI as well with the same syntax.
